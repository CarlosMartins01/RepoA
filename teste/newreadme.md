# Apiproxy
Apiproxy configurations

Updating the envionment specific haproxy.cfg file and checking into master on this repo will trigger
https://ecm.jenkins.int.godaddy.com/job/ECM/job/apiproxy/job/master
which lays down the file in the appropriate apiproxy environment and reloads the config.

The haproxy.cfg files in this repo should no longer be edited directly.   They are built from the
yaml config file in environments/[dev|test|prod]/haproxy.yaml .   Update this file, then
to rebuild config...
```
./haproxy-configuration-builder/haproxy_configuration_builder/builder.py --conf [dev|test|prod]
```
Note: you will also need ruby installed

To add certificate pem files, please run this jenkins job - [apiproxy_cert_install](https://ecm.jenkins.int.godaddy.com/job/apiproxy_cert_install)

### Steps-by-Step to perform Apiproxy.

Clone apiproxy repository. "Check if you already have this repository local before clone."
Edit <environment>/haproxy.yaml. Where <environment> could be [dev|test|prod]. Add client: cn: and client name at backend entry.

Run ./haproxy-configuration-builder/haproxy_configuration_builder/builder.py --conf [dev|test|prod]
    
Commit it and push to origin:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message."
    - git push 
Create a PR in GitHub, repository ECM/apiproxy. Wait for approval.

Install certificates at using the Jenkins job at: Jenkins [apiproxy_cert_install](https://ecm.jenkins.int.godaddy.com/job/apiproxy_cert_install).
Confirm installation at [ecm_monitors](https://godaddy.slack.com/archives/C04S9FGV4) slack channel.

```
```
---
client: provisioning
cn: provisioning.api.client.test-sucuri.net

```
and
```
<br/>
Messaging does not accept new entries.
<br/>
```

### Monitoring

Monitoring is displayed at "ecm_monitors Slack channel". It will display a message with # job you runned at the jenkins job with a GREEN mark for success or RED mark for failure.

[ecm_monitors](https://godaddy.slack.com/archives/C04S9FGV4) - Slack channel.

### Knowledge Base

If you have a RED error message at ecm_monitor check if you ran the jenkins job.
